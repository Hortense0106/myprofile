				<h2> Passions </h2>
					<p> Music has always been a passion for me since I was young. Playing music is a way for me to escape the daily routine and express myself creatively. I have a great passion for musicals because they combine music, dance, and theater. I enjoy seeing how these different elements can tell a story and evoke emotions. I also have a passion for tennis, which allows me to lead an active and healthy lifestyle while developing my competitive spirit.  </p>

				<p>I feel a deep desire to participate in humanitarian projects to help those in need and make a positive contribution to the world. By getting involved in humanitarian projects, I want to be useful to society and give hope for the future. I believe this will also allow me to develop my skills, meet inspiring people, and discover different cultures. Participating in humanitarian projects is an opportunity for me to make a difference in the world and contribute to a better world. </p>
